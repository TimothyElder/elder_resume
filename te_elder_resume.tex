% Current Projects
\begin{rSection}{Current Projects}
\noindent \textbf{An Assembly of Choice: Success, Failure and Professional Identity in Palliative Medicine}  \\
\textit{Dissertation, Department of Sociology} %\hfill Month, Year $-$ August, 2020
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Qualitative interview study which seeks to better understand how physicians in palliative medicine create a set of choices for patients experiencing life-limiting and terminal illness. }
\item { Drawing on several sociological literatures I explore how these kinds of physicians create metrics of success in conditions consider by most other kinds of physicians to be ``No win scenarios''. Further, I explore several tensions in medical practice but primarily between patient autonomy and physician expertise. \\}

\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Status Hierarchies in Sociology Departments and Subfields}  \\
\textit{Ongoing Research} %\hfill Month, Year $-$ August, 2020
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Using Python, R, and Optical Character Recognition to digitize physical text, created a novel dataset of all sociologists at PhD granting departments for the last 10 years. Analyzing the data with Exponential Random Graph Models and a variety of centrality measures, examines the distribution of evaluations of prestige across research subfields and interests.}
\item {Initial findings show that research interests are stratified by attributions of ``prestige'', the perception of achievement or quality, particularly associated with race and gender with research interests of African American and Female academics receiving lower evaluations of quality, a further form of stratification and discrimination in scientific enterprises. \\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{The Prevalence and Predictors of the Use of Advance Directives In Long Term Care
Patients} \\
\textit{Ongoing Research} %\hfill Month, Year $-$ August, 2020
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Leveraged R and STATA to analyze two waves of CDC survey data to identify predictors for when long term care patients establish an Advance Directive, a legal document which specifies the type of healthcare they want to receive in case of a medical emergency.}
\item {Utilizing logistic regression to explore several features of a patient's disease trajectory and symptom burden to better understand the circumstances in which they establish advance directives.}
\item {Research will extend findings with a second wave of data to be released in early 2021. \\}
